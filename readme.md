- Linked list is a form of sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and it has a reference to the next node in the link. 

- The first node is called HEAD and the last node is called the TAIL of the linked list.

## Arrays vs linked list

# Arrays
- Elements in arrays are NOT independent objects. 
- The size of an array is always predefined.
- Random access - accessing an elements in the case of an array is very efficient. That means that we can access the element based on the index in the array. O(n) = 1.

# Linked list
- Elements of linked list are independent objects. This means that we can remove an object from the middle of a linked list 
- Variable size - the size of a linked list is not pre-defined.
- Random access - accessing an elements in the case of a linked list is NOT efficient as we have to traverse through all elements till we reach the desired elements. O(n) = n


## Types of linked list

- Singly linked list
- Circular singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular doubly linked list
