- Linked list is a form of sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and it has a reference to the next node in the link. 

- The first node is called HEAD and the last node is called the TAIL of the linked list.

## Arrays vs linked list

# Arrays
- Elements in arrays are NOT independent objects. 
- The size of an array is always predefined.
- Random access - accessing an elements in the case of an array is very efficient. That means that we can access the element based on the index in the array. O(n) = 1.

# Linked list
- Elements of linked list are independent objects. This means that we can remove an object from the middle of a linked list 
- Variable size - the size of a linked list is not pre-defined. This allows us dynamic resizing at runtime.
- Random access - accessing an elements in the case of a linked list is NOT efficient as we have to traverse through all elements till we reach the desired elements. O(n) = n


## Types of linked list

- Singly linked list(Example: any trivial application of a lined list)
- Circular singly linked list(Example: a chess game in that how the turns switches among players)
- Doubly linked list(Example: a music play list)
- Circular doubly linked list(Example: ctrl+tab/ctrl+shift+tab function in Linux OS)

# Linked list in memory

- TODO: Add a diagram representing linked list in memory.

# Creation of a singly linked list

The creation of a singly linked list follows the following pseudo code:

- TODO: Add a diagram representing creation of singly linked list.

# Insertion to Linked List in memory

The following three variations are  possible for insertion in a singly linked list:

- At the beginning of a linked list
- After a node in the middle of linekd list
- At the end of a linked list

- TODO: Create 3 diagrams showing step-by-step of insertion of Singly Linked List in memory. (89)


# Traversal of a singly linked list

Time complexity: O(n)

# Singly linked list deletion of a node

- TODO: Add a diagram depicting the deletion in a singly linked list. (93)
Time complexity: O(n)

# Deleting entire singly linked list
- TODO: Add a diagram depicting the deletion in a singly linked list. (95)
Time complexity: O(1)

# Time and space complexity of the singly linked list
- TODO: Add a diagram depicting the deletion in a singly linked list. (96)


## Circular singly linked list
- TODO: Add a diagram depicting the deletion in a singly linked list. (98) x2
- Time complexity of creation with one node: O(1).

# Creation - Circular singly linked list
-  Diagram with changes (3x) (99).

# Insertion - Circular singly linked list
-  Diagram with changes (1x) (100).
